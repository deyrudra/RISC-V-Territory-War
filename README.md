# RISC-V-Territory-War
 Territory War Game on the Risc-V CPU.



**Project Proposal (Approved)**

1. Sean Nishanthan and Rudra Dey
2. Monday 3-6 pm
3. Territory War (**New Game Proposal, since TA said the old one is not complex enough.**). This is a game where 2 players, control a team of three characters and try to claim their territory by taking the lives of the other playerâ€™s characters. There are several ways one could do this, using a short-range gun, grenade, or a kick. This is a turn-based game, where one player moves one character at a time. The turn starts with moving the character using arrow keys (with maximum displacement allowed). The player picks a weapon for the character (gun, grenade, or boot), then the player aims their weapon, and initiates an attack. Once all characters on a team are deceased, then the opposing team wins.

We will use VGA to output the graphics and animation for the players on a particular map. We will use PS2 keyboard input for moving the characters (arrow keys + spacebar), choosing the weapons (with numbers), aiming the weapon (arrow keys). Audio will be used for background music, and sound effects (for gun shots, unclipping grenades, and kicking).
